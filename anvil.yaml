  description: 'This app is intended to link good neighbours who might have provisions
    or medicine they can spare, with people who may be more in need and close enough
    that delivering by hand or vehicle is an easy option.  When complete, it will
    attempt to auto-match offers and requests and assign to delivery volunteers and
    other 3rd sector/governement support groups to help move items around to where
    they''ve most needed.'}
