      text: '1) The personal information you''ve provided to use this app will ONLY
        be used for the intended purpose of the app itself i.e. making and matching
        requests and offers for goods and deliveries during these unprecedented times
        of "lock-down" due to the Corona Virus pandemic.


        2) Other registered users of the app will only be able to see your Display
        Name and Street by default (e.g. Big John, Armoury Way).  Your Full Address
        will obviously need to be shared with any registered volunteers you accept
        to pick-up or deliver goods from/to your address, but it''s up to you whether
        you share your Email or Telephone Number as well.  Hopefully you''ll be able
        to have a quick chat (at a safe social distance) when the volunteer comes
        to your house, and you can always share your contact information in person
        once you''re more comfortable and know there''s a real person behind the profile
        name...


        3) Some registered users will actually be organisations approved by us such
        as Food Banks and other charities or community groups who are doing their
        bit to help out in the local area.  In these cases your generous offers may
        end up going into a ''pool'' of donations managed by them, rather than a close
        neighbour directly, but you''ll be able to choose whether you accept such
        requests or not.


        4) We need your email address firstly for password confirmation and resets,
        but also to  notify you automatically when the system is waiting for you to
        log in and take action (e.g. approve a delivery).  Until we can implement
        an in-app messaging system, email is also our only way to keep you up to date
        with news and announcements about the app itself.


        5) As well as holding your contact details and any active Offers or Requests,
        we will also keep a history of your activity using this app.  The idea there
        is to build up a kind of "reputation"  score so that we can all see who the
        ''good eggs'' are (typically offering more than they ask for) or if there
        are any scammers or plain selfish neighbours trying to take advantage (e.g.
        requesting more of a particular item than they could reasonably need for their
        own use, or offering to make deliveries but keeping the items to themselves).


        6) Please note that whatever you write in the Notes part of an Offer or Request,
        and also any Feedback you give on particular Users/Transactions will be publicly
        viewable, so please DO NOT include any personal information about other registered
        users AT ALL other than Display Name and Street (the default public information)
        and only include details about yourself that you are comfortable sharing with
        all users.


        7) Finally in terms of IT security, we''re using out-of-the-box toolkits provided
        by Anvil.works and all data is hosted on their servers, including encrypted
        password ''hashes''.  The developers of this app are not IT security experts
        but felt comfortable and reassured when researching Anvil''s architecture
        and security framework.  If you have any concerns about security you change
        your password in the My Data menu, read up on Anvil itself, and as a last
        resort, delete your account here entirely - though we hope it won''t come
        to that!


        Thanks for sharing your details in order to make this app work for the benefit
        of all.  What goes around, comes around!', font_size: null, auto_expand: false,
